Please arrive on time as we will start exactly at 6:30 PM.\n\nOur intention is to have this training be the 'next step' after our beginner-level training at North Melbourne Community Centre.\n\nWe will be focusing on learning what specific roles on the court entail, improving 'volleyball IQ', breaking bad habits, and building better techniques.\n\n**[[WHERE]]**\n\nThe session will be held as Pascoe Vale Girls College.\n\nPlease enter via Cornwall Road through the back gates as other entrances onto the campus will be closed\n\n**[[WHO]]**\n\nThe training is intended for social volleyball players at the intermediate level or 'B' level (for more details on volleyball levels, please visit our site here: https://melbournevolleyballacademy.com.au/skill-levels-explained).\n\nPlayers are expected to:\n\n* have strong fundamentals\n* pass freeballs and serve receive consistently\n* understand 4-2 system (pass middle rotation)\n* have some knowledge of 5-1 (1 setter all around) or 6-2 (back row setter only) systems\n* understand 'base defense'\n* help others and have good sportsmanship\n\nIf you are a high intermediate (BB) or advanced player (A) you are more than welcome to join but you may find our open play sessions for BB/A level players more suitable.\n\nFor players that are at the beginner level, we suggest attending our training on Fridays at North Melbourne Community Centre 6-9PM as beginners may find the drills and level of play too difficult.\n\nPlayers will be asked to attend a different session if their play is deemed unsafe or if they are not of the appropriate skill level.\n\n**[[HOW MUCH]]**\n\n$21 card payment will be collected on the day via square (EFTPOS) payment.\n\n**[[WHEN]]**\n\nThe stadium is booked for 6:30 PM - 9:30 PM. However, feel free to come early and stretch as the stadium is open earlier.\n\n**Last-minute dropouts and no-shows will have a zero-tolerance policy going forward.**\n\nAll players are expected to **update their RSVP at least 24 hours** in advance if they are unable to attend. This applies to players on the going list and the waitlist.\n\n**[[THINGS TO BRING]]**\n\nWe ask that you bring:\n\n* Water bottle\n* Appropriate footwear for indoor court shoes - netball shoes, volleyball shoes, or basketball shoes would be suitable.\n* Wear contacts or sports glasses if possible.\n\n**[[OTHER DETAILS]]**\n\nOnly those on the “going” list are permitted to play.
